dcom_x1_description=This rule is applied to a Component.\
\nIt checks that all Function Ports of the allocated functions that are connected to a Functional Exchange that is an external interface for the Component, is allocated to a Component Port.\
The rule considers functions that are allocated to the component.\
\nThe rule looks for:\
\n\t- External functional interface: Function Ports connected to Functional Exchanges that connecting other Component/Actor\
\n\t- Notice that other completeness rules must be run to ensure that all external interfaces are well identified (allocation of functions, function ports)\
A result line is generated for each problematic Function Port.
